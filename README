What is ``Cabot``?
==================

"cabot" is a French word which familiarly describes a dog, with a slight
despising flavour added in.  But here, it is a personal IRC bot meant to
index or describe my own projects and interests.  I might also make it
available and useful to the Python community.

It is meant to grow in the line and spirit of the very nice ``fsbot``
as seen on the ``#emacs`` channel among others; ``fsbot`` is an ErBot
instance developed and maintained by Deepak Goel (known as ``deego``).

This is still all pretty preliminary and exploratory.  These files are
only available so people may peek at them if they feel like it.
